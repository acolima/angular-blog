    review: `8.5/10 While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even 
      more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal 
      with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with 
      this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, 
      Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically 
      for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward 
      and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie 
      is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most 
      original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan 
      Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, 
      and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the 
      soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice "Barbie World" song 
      that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish "What Was I Made For?" tune 
      that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to 
      played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and 
      emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable 
      flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, 
      and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more 
      the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, 
      definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible 
      to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, 
      good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.`,

    review: `Such an important film! Shows true love - real love for what it 
    is for everyone! Love is love. This film is shot well, written 
    brilliantly and has this magnificent charm throughout. For anyone 
    having trouble accepting a gay family member - this should be a must watch. 
    It is just an absolute brilliant display of humanity with an appropriate 
    Hallmark movie feel that pulls one in to the sweetness of life. Bravo 
    to Amazon for mainstreaming this issue for us all- yes even today it is 
    important. The two lead actors are delightful, and brilliant and never 
    once did I think about their performance, rather captivated by the 
    story telling. Bravo! Powerful. Charming. Super acting.`,

    review: `One of the biggest surprises of the year. It's also one of the 
      funniest superhero movies ever with a very distinctive identity. There are 
      some typical exposition dumps for the genre, and the emotional moments 
      don't always hit the mark with a familiar structure, but it's a film with 
      a huge heart, incredibly good humor, and excellent characters. All the 
      "good side" characters are very well crafted and distinct, each of them 
      having moments to shine. In technical terms, it has some surprises and 
      tricks up its sleeve, with good editing, well-choreographed and entertaining 
      fast-paced action, and a strong score and soundtrack. What's even better is 
      the way it incorporates Latin culture to show us the true sense of community 
      and family, elevating the film's message and contributing to most of the arcs.
      All the performances are outstanding. Madridueña has what it takes to be the 
      star of this film and all of them deserve praises, but the best is the 
      crazy uncle portrayed by George Lopez. Good movie even if you are tired 
      of superhero movies.`,

    review: `It's honestly absurd how good the "Spider-Verse" movies are. 
      "Across the Spider-Verse" is just as great, if not better than "Into 
      the Spider-Verse". I really don't know how. "Spider-Man: Across the 
      Spider-Verse" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character 
      beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many 
      delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes 
      with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special. Can't wait for the 
      third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink 
      because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & 
      over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this 
      film that I truly wasn't expecting. "Across the Spider-Verse" is another 
      milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, 
      but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his 
      family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration 
      for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, 
      comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come 
      second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, 
      it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's 
      real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.
      What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves 
      to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. 
      It's outstanding. "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" is yet another 
      resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld 
      really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I 
      expected, but necessary.`,

    review: `You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully 
      switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a 
      nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's 
      audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information 
      at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's 
      life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual 
      clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have 
      to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps 
      to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the 
      atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best 
      performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors 
      the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole 
      cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily 
        Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return 
        to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The 
        screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), 
        cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued 
        with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with 
          Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious 
          and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime 
          flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly 
          rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.`,
